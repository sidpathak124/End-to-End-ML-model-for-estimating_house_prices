This data science project goes through an End-to-End process of building a real estate price prediction website :- 
1) We will first built an ML model (using sklearn and linear regression) by training it on banglore home prices dataset (taken from kaggle.com). 
2) Next, we wrote a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. 
3) We then built a website using html, css and javascript that allows user to enter parameters for any home like: <br>
   Area (in Square ft), Number of bedrooms, Number of bathrooms and Location. This event will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
